## 🔥 The APEX Principles

### The 5 Non-Negotiables

1. **⏰ Consistency Over Intensity**
   - 14h EVERY week beats 40h once a month
   - Never skip more than 1 day
   - Minimum viable session: 30 minutes

2. **🎯 Focus on High-Impact**
   - 80/20 rule ruthlessly applied
   - Critical skills only in Phase 1
   - No tutorial hell, build real projects

3. **🛠️ Build > Consume**
   - 70% doing, 30% learning
   - Every skill = 1 concrete project
   - Public shipping builds credibility

4. **🔄 Review & Iterate**
   - Weekly: What worked? What didn't?
   - Monthly: Am I on track?
   - Quarterly: Adjust strategy

5. **🧘 Strategic Recovery**
   - 1 week off every 3 months
   - Prevent burnout before it starts
   - Return stronger, not depleted

## 🚨 Risk Management & Mitigation

### Top 5 Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Burnout** | High | Critical | Mandatory rest weeks, 14h max |
| **Lost Motivation** | Medium | High | Monthly milestone reviews, public accountability |
| **Financial Pressure** | Medium | High | Job-securing skills first, side income parallel |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Medium | Medium | "Just ship something" rule, 2-week build cycles |
| **Skill Obsolescence** | Low | Medium | Focus on fundamentals, monitor trends monthly |

### Emergency Protocols

**If motivation drops:**
1. Review "Why I Started" document
2. Connect with accountability partner
3. Take 3-day break (guilt-free)
4. Return with smaller, easier wins

**If falling behind:**
1. Recalibrate to Core Path (2,800h)
2. Focus on critical skills only
3. Extend timeline if needed
4. Never compromise on quality
